Welcome to the Scientrace sample simulations.

The easiest and fastest way to learn Scientrace is by studying the Scientrace XML and the Scientrace BatchCreator examples in the underlying directories.

When Scientrace is properly installed, several commands should be available on the console prompt. Let's introduce them briefly:

* scientrace-xml:
	This is the Scientrace-XML interpreter. This is your main accesspoint to using Scientrace (wich is actually "just" the engine called by Scientrace-XML). The easiest way to perform a simulation is by calling Scientrace with a single parameter: the XML file to read/simulate. For example, when executing "scientrace-xml plates_setup.scx", the file "plates_setup.scx" (a file from the "polarizing plates" example, the SCX extension stands for "SCientrace Xml") is read from the current path. The output generated by Scientrace-XML is written to the "out" subdirectory, which will be prompted for creation when it does not yet exist.

* scientrace-batch-creator: 
	This is the so called "Batch Creator", which enables the user to create a full series of simulations based on an SCX file (which can be read by scientrace-xml) and a Scientrace Batch Creator configuration XML (BCX) file. When the SCX file contains variables, these values can be varied in the BCX file. When different parameters are varied simultaniously, the number of SCX configuration to be simulated increases exponentially. For each unique configuration of parameters, an individual SCX file is created in a subdir. These files can be parsed individually by "scientrace-xml", but it is also possible to parse all ".scx" files (mind the lowercase of the extension) in the current directory by calling "scientrace-xml-all".

* scientrace-xml-all:
	This script will simply call "scientrace-xml" for every single ".scx" (mind the lowercase) file in the current directory. Every file that was succesfully simulated is afterwards moved to the "done" subdirectory. Files that produced errors are moved to the "error" subdirectory.


So, in order to view the examples I'd suggest the following. Copy one of the example dirs to your homedir (e.g. "mkdir ~/scientrace_simulations/; cp -a /usr/lib/scientrace/example_simulations/polarizing_plates ~/scientrace_simulations/"), get your shell into that directory, and create the batch based on the BCX file (e.g. "scientrace-batch-creator vary_plates.bcx"). Upon request, allow the scientrace-batch-creator to create the "xml" subdir. After creation of the "batch" SCX files, get into the XML subdir to find out whether they've been created. Now perform a batch simulation by running "scientrace-xml-all" inside this xml subdir and allow scientrace-xml to create the suggested subdirs. Explore the "out" subdir of the "xml" subdir for the simulation results. The SVG files can be opened using any modern browser. The 3D files (.x3d) can be opened by any viewer with X3D support, such as "view3dscene" which is available at most current linux repositories. The comma seperated values (.csv) can be opened using a spreadsheet application.

Good luck!
