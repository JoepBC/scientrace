The simulation files in this folder are used in a study that examines the effects of the angle of incidence (AOI) on the performance of a concentrator solar cell. 

Two types of simulations were performed:
* The effects of secondary optical elements (SOEs) on the performance of a system and the distributions of incident angles (Experiments 01 - 03).
* The losses in cell performance, introduced by the shape and surface properties of the front metal grid (Experiment 04).

All simulation files have been tested to work with Scientrace version 0.8.0-2. The study was performed together with Leon Bunthof at the Applied Materials Science department of the Radboud University ( http://www.ru.nl/appliedmaterialsscience/ ).
