The Wulff Construction (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wulff_construction) named after its discoverer George (Yuri Viktorovich) Wulff (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wulff) is a method to determine the equilibrium shape of a droplet or crystal of fixed volume inside a separate phase (usually its saturated solution or vapor).
